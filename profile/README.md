## Description

At the Mars Preserve Research Foundation
we strive to do good, while providing a safe
and effective routine that gets the job done
in terms of growing and farming making any 
adjustments that are needed and or modifications.

# Welcome 🍊

Welcome to the DIY farming project, designed for enthusiasts who want to grow plants in a controlled environment.

This project focuses on using a climate-controlled connex box to support plant growth by managing key environmental variables such as:

- **Humidity**
- **Condensation**
- **Temperature**

By optimizing these variables, healthy and consistent plant growth can be achieved.

## Farming Solutions

### Auto-Growth Climate Box

Our vision is to create climate-controlled growing solutions using modified connex boxes. These systems are designed to provide:

- **Sustainable Growth Solutions**: Supporting long-term, eco-friendly farming practices.
- **Results-Driven Improvements**: Iterative testing and refinement of systems.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Running test cases to improve efficiency and outcomes.

These systems are ideal for growing food in controlled environments, enabling farmers to experiment and innovate.

## Sustainable Farming with the Mars Preserve Foundation

At the Mars Preserve Foundation, we develop advanced farming systems to help farmers conduct experiments and post-production tests. Our climate-engineered connex boxes are designed to promote sustainable growth and empower farmers to achieve their goals.

## Learning Roadmap

"Growing Forward" is our philosophy—finding the space and time to farm effectively. Connex climate growth boxes allow farmers to:

- Grow crops in confined, controlled spaces.
- Manage the growth cycle of plants with precision.
- Use tools and data-driven insights to meet farming objectives.

By combining innovation and sustainability, we aim to make farming more accessible and efficient.

## Test Case Workflow

1. Build the system.
2. Manage project overhead.
3. Optimize the workspace.
4. Achieve profitability.
